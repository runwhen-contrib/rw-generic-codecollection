Documentation       Runs an ad-hoc user-provided command, and pushes the command's stdout as the health metric.
...                 If no output is produced, the resulting metric is empty; if the command produces output, that exact text is used as the metric.
...                 User commands should produce the desired health metric or numeric value if neededâ€”e.g., output "0" if unhealthy or "1" if healthy.
