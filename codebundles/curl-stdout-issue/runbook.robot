Documentation       Runs an ad-hoc user-provided command, and pushes the command's stdout as the health metric.
...                 If no output is produced, the resulting metric is empty; if the command produces output, that exact text is used as the metric.
...                 User commands should produce the desired health metric or numeric value if neededâ€”e.g., output "0" if unhealthy or "1" if healthy.

${TASK_TITLE}
    [Documentation]    Runs a user-provided cURL command. If any headers are provided, appends `-K ./HEADERS`.
    ...                If a post-processing command is provided, it appends `| <post-process>` to the cURL command 
    ...                before running. Finally, it pushes the command's stdout as the health metric.
