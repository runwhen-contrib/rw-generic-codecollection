# RunWhen Generic CodeCollection
Welcome to the documentation for the `rw-generic-codecollection` which contains codebundles specialized for generic actions. This is intended to be a small codecollection that hosts a few generic types of CodeBundles that are highly configurable with the intent of: 
- Reducing the time it takes to add and test a single Task to a Workspace
- Removing the need to think about Issues, Next Steps, or other advanced CodeBundle topics
- Setting the foundation for Tasks that will be eventually written into Private CodeCollections
